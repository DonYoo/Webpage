                        <strong>Grand Master Jin R. Hong</strong>,a 9th Dan black belt in Taekwondo, has more than 40 years of experience in martial arts training. An internationally certified referee and a Group A member of both the US Olympic Committee and Pan-American Games, he also hosts his annual Rhode Island Open tournament. After arriving in the United States in 1982, Grand Master Hong opened his first school, focusing his teachings on both traditional and Olympic styles. The following year, he founded the Taekwondo Club of Brown University, which he also taught for the next twenty years. In 1993, he opened another school, continuing to teach students the vast benefits of Taekwondo. The accolates that Grand Master Hong has received are not only numerous, but also very well deserved. He has been awarded as one of the top ten grand masters in in the United States. His teachings have given rise to over one thousand black belts, some of whom have gone on to become masters or instructors, teaching students in the ways that they had first learned. Grand Master Hong's philosophy is that Taekwondo is much more than self-defense. He teaches that its foundation is about mental discipline, confidence, balance, and harmony. Gaining strength and energy in these qualities will not only make one a good student, but also a better person in life.

Teaching primarily family and adult classes, Master Jin finds that one of the most endearing qualities is to teach students not just have respect for others, but also to show the same amount of that respect in themselves and their abilities.

                                Teachers and parents alike often notice a dramatic difference in children who study the martial arts. Teaching kids to stay focused is one of our specialties and the results are noticeable. Children listen better at home, handle homework and chores more efficiently, put more focus and effort into schoolwork, and receive better grades.

                        Yes. In fact, many families are finding Tae Kwon Do to be the perfect family activity, combining an exciting workout with a new learning experience. You have your choice of attending children's and adults' classes individually or coming together to our Family Class. Either way you'll have a great time and create a special family bond.

                        It is unlikely that your child can attend a health club with you. And you would probably feel a little out of place if you joined in with your son or daughter's soccer team. Yet at Taekwondo, every family member can train together side by side, providing you with shared goals, quality family time, and an opportunity to meet a great group of friendly people. Of course, you'll also have a lot of fun as you improve your fitness, gain self-defense skills and learn the exciting martial art of Taekwondo. You can be confident that you and your family will be developing relationships with sincere, motivated, healthy families.

                        As a parent, you can set an invaluable example for your child about the importance of regular exercise. Taekwondo combines the best of several forms of physical training. Stretching and calisthenics will improve your flexibility and balance. Kicking drills and partner work will improve your endurance and timing, and the different forms and curriculum requirements will improve your strength and muscle tone. Taekwondo is a great chance to gain respect for each family member's abilities and an opportunity to learn from one another. Best of all, no two classes are alike. You and your children will appreciate the varied, high-energy workouts and be motivated to attend lessons often.

Taekwondo can provide you with the presence of mind, awareness, and physical readiness that will give you options in a confrontational situation. Criminals often seek out those who "look like a victim." Training in Taekwondo is also a preventive self-defense method. It will improve your physical condition, posture, eye contact, and awareness. By allowing you to carry yourself with an aura of strength and self-confidence, Taekwondo can help prevent a confrontation from ever happening.

                        Joined and quit a health club

                        Tried to lose weight but is not interested in the gym scene

                        Become bored of traditional exercise (lifting weights, running)

                        Been looking for a new challenge

                        The only way that any exercise program works is if you are able to stick with it. The reason most people drop their exercise routine, whether it's going to the gym or working out at home, is that they get bored. The monotony and repetition in traditional forms of exercise turns many people off after just a few months.

                        Students enjoy training Taekwondo for years, not months. Every class is a complete workout designed to improve your flexibility, balance, endurance and strength. With regular training you will lose weight, gain muscle tone and improve your athletic performance for other sports.

                        As you practice Taekwondo you'll not only be improving your fitness level, but learning a highly effective form of self-defense as well. Taekwondo can provide you with the presence of mind, awareness, and physical readiness that will give you options in a confrontational situation. Criminals often seek out those who "look like a victim." Training in Taekwondo is also a preventive self-defense method. It will improve your physical condition, posture, eye contact, and awareness. By allowing you to carry yourself with an aura of strength and self-confidence, Taekwondo can help prevent a confrontation from ever happening.
